We develop a framework for implementing Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems (SINDy) with autoencoders for simultaneous data-driven discovery of coordinates and governing equations as originally proposed by \textcite{Champion_2019}. The proposed implementation represents a modular framework, allowing for ease of control over the different aspects of the SINDy autoencoder. With our implementation, we utilized SINDy autoencoders to re-discover the dynamics of a lorenz system, and a non-linear pendulum example, achieving similar results to the original paper. Nevertheless, questions regarding the stability and convergence of the method remain.
